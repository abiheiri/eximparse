eximparse
=========

*Generate statistics based on exim logs* 



SHOULD HAVE:
-----------

* Size of each log file
* Start and end time of each log file
* Total mail sent
	we want to capture => + ipaddress + hostname (H=)

* Total mail recieved
	we want to capture <= + ipaddress + hostname (H=)

* Total frozen mail messages
	capture [Ff]rozen

* Total "unsolicited" mail
	"google" count: #

* Total mail rejected
	"unroutable": #
	"spamhaus.org": #
	"relay not permitted": #
	other: #


* Number of mail messages delayed          
	<= + "delayed"

* Messages received per hour
	##:00 + <=

* Deliveries per hour
	##:00 + =>


NICE TO HAVE:
------------

* Time spent on the queue: all messages
* Time spent on the queue: messages with at least one remote delivery
* Top XX sending hosts by message count (capture IP and hostname b/c according to exim manpage (i think) hostname can be manipulated so IP is more certain)
* Top XX host destinations by message count (capture IP and hostname)
* Top XX rejected ips by message count  (capture IP and hostname)
* Top XX temporarily rejected ips by message count (capture IP and hostname)
* optimize runtime of the code
